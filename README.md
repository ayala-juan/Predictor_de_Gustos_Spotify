# Spotify Song Classification
This is an implementation of a song classifier. The idea is that using a given dataset (below), we are able to predict whether the user will like or not a new song by extracting its attributes directly from Spotify.

# Dataset - How to get
This repository work with George McIntire's dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/geomack). To download this dataset please head to his official site and download it: https://www.kaggle.com/geomack/spotifyclassification. We work with its original name (data.csv) so you don't need to change it.
